# Layton area puzzle cache

# Announcements:
Saturday 08/24/2024: The master file has been released [Download it here](https://github.com/JosephD-03/JosephD-03/blob/main/MasterFile.zip)! I am excited for people to start finding the caches! :)
Feel free to use the files to create puzzle caches in your local area :)


## About:
My goal is to project to provide "indoorsy" people a fun way to collaborate with their "outdoorsy" friends/family, and to give myself a fun hobby incorporating my interests in computers/electronics with my love for the outdoors. My hope is to eventually include some electronic components, multiple courses, and a variety of puzzles for the course—and a better website.
Rules:
1.	You understand the disclaimer below
2.	Respect my stuff (I spent my own time and money to provide this)
3.	No spoilers
4.	Be respectful of the environment and landowners
5.	This site/repo is the only public platform for finding these geocaches.

## Feedback:
I want people to have fun with this! When you find the last geocache, there is a QR code to give some constructive feedback.

## FAQ:
Q: Do I need to hike a lot? Is it hard to get to the caches?
A: The farthest you will have to go to find a cache is ~3.0 miles round trip. The physical difficulty of getting to each cache will vary.**
**see disclaimer

Q: How big is the prize?
A: Don’t quit your job to find it… Maybe lunch for you and a friend. There might be some significance to the numbers 2 and 22 ;)

Q: Has someone already found the prize? Will there be more than one prize? 
A: Check back on this page for announcements!

Q: Can I ask you for help?
A: Certainly, just reach out through the GitHub page, or if you know me, feel free to contact me directly (Face Book, email, SMS, etc.) 

Q: I see “Phase one” on the password slip, what is phase 2?
A: I am still figuring that out

Q: Can’t I just brute force the passwords?
A: Good luck. If you try this, and are successful, I would love to hear how you did it!

Q: Is there some kind of business here?
A: My profits on this project are the enjoyment you get from having fun!

Q: How long will the course be available?
A: I plan to keep it out at least till at least mid October, we’ll see how it evolves over this summer.

Q: Can kids do it?
A: 1.) Parents/guardians: you are the ones responsible for that decision. ** 2.) The puzzles can be completed on paper with a computer or phone disconnected from the internet, and I reckon that all the hikes could be do-able by an older child (9-12 years). It will be obvious what hike you are going to need to do to get very close to each cache. Consider using an app like AllTrails  to see what to expect.
